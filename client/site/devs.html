			<h1>What is Paperbots?</h1>

			<p>
				Paperbots is an educational programming environment running in the browser. It
				was created to enable teaching or self-learning of computational thinking and programming.
			</p>

			<p>Paperbots consists of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/paperbots/tree/master/client/src/language">Wee programming language, compiler and virtual machine.</a></li>
				<li>The <a href="/">Paperbots website</a>, where users can
					<ul>
						<li>Create an account.</li>
						<li>Create programs for different micro worlds in a browser based IDE.</li>
						<li>Save programs to their account.</li>
						<li>Share programs with others.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The <a href="/learn.html">Paperbots course</a> guiding beginner's through learning computational thinking and programming.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Why Paperbots?</h1>
			<p>
				The foremost goal of Paperbots is to make it easier to learn (and teach) computational
				thinking and programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many educational programming environments, like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>,
				commonly in use in computing education. Scratch is a great way to give kids up until the age of 12 a taste
				of computing. However, past that age, Scratch is viewed as being "for kids" and "not being the real deal".
				Young adults want something that is closer to the "real world". It is also not immediately clear
				how to go from Scratch to a "real" programming environment.
			<p>
				In that real world, "professional" programming languages, like Python or Lua, are touted as being great for
				beginners. While these languages are indeed great, their surrounding programming
				environments and ecosystems are very complex. It is non-trivial to get setup, and the development
				environments are overwhelming. It is also very hard to share programs you've created with
				these tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Paperbots, I'm trying to build a bridge between the world of Scratch and professional programming
				environments.
			</p>

			<h1>I know how to program, why should I care?</h1>
			<p>
				Because Paperbots is not only an educational tool, but also a recreational tool. If you are looking
				for a simple environment to quickly whip up and share ideas for small games or generative art,
				Paperbots might be for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a side-effect, your programs can serve as inspiration for beginners! And maybe yourself
				have kids or friends who'd like to get a glimpse into computational programming. Maybe Paperbots
				can be their pathway into that particular rabbit hole.
			</p>

			<h1>How to use this site</h1>
			<h2>Accounting</h2>
			<p>
				You may already have noticed the <code>Sign up</code> and <code>Log in</code> buttons in the top
				right corner.
			</p>
			<img src="/img/devs/login-signup.png">
			<p>
				You can create a new account with the former, or log in with the latter by providing
				your user name or email address.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you are logged in, your <code>user name</code> will appear in the top right corner. Click it to quickly
				access your most recent programs, view your profile, or log out.
			</p>
			<img src="/img/devs/user.png">
			<p>
				With an account, you can save and share your programs, and access them from multiple devices.
				That said, an account is not a requirement for creating programs on this site. They will however
				get lost forever as soon as you close the browser tab.
			</p>

			<h2>Creating and saving programs</h2>
			<img src="/img/devs/newsave.png">
			<p>
				The <code>New</code> button in the top left corner will open a blank program in the Paperbots IDE.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside the IDE, you will get an additional button called <code>Save</code> that lets you save your
				program (provided you are logged in). The <code>Save</code> is also available when viewing other people's
				projects. Clicking it will save a copy of that program into your account.
			</p>

			<h2>A quick IDE tour</h2>
			<img src="/img/devs/ide.png">
			<h3>Toolbar</h3>
			<p>
				At the top of the IDE, you find the buttons to create a new program, or save the current one. Next
				to these buttons, you can see the <code>program's title</code>, which you can edit. If the program
				belongs to another user, the toolbar will state the user name.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you click "Save", the program's title, code, and the micro world setup will be saved, overwritting
				the last saved version of the program.
			</p>
			<h3>Code editor</h3>
			<p>
				The source code of your program is entered in the code editor (the panel labeled
				with <code>PROGRAM</code>). It will display errors detected by the compiler at the bottom
				of the code editor, and highlight the errornous part of the program.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <code>eye icon</code> in the top right lets you enable and disable embedding of image and YouTube URLs
				inside the code editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can click to the left of a line number to set a <code>breakpoint</code> for that line.
			</p>
			<h3>Help</h3>
			<p>
				The <code>HELP</code> panel shows all available functions and language syntax. You can collapse
				the panel by clicking on its header (the gray part saying "HELP"), to make more room for the code
				editor.
			</p>
			<p>
				The micro world may provide additional functions on top of the built-in functions of the
				programming language. These will be shown at the top of the help panel.
			</p>
			<h3>Debugger</h3>
			<p>
				To the left of the code editor and help panel, you can see the collapsed debugger panel. Clicking
				on the <code>green play button</code> will run the program. Clicking the <code>red bug button</code>
				will start the program and pause it at the first statement that is going to be executed.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can stop the program at any time by clicking the <code>stop button</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can pause the program at any time by clicking the <code>pause button</code>. The program will
				halt on the line that it will execute next.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a program is paused, you can resume it by clicking the <code>resume button</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a program is paused, you can use the <code>step over</code> and <code>step in</code>
				buttons to step over the next statement, or, if the next statement calls a function, step
				into that function.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the debugger shows you all <code>variables</code> currently in scope, as well
				as the <code>callstack</code>. Clicking on a variable will highlight it in the code
				editor. Clicking on a frame in the callstack will highlight the statement the frame will
				execute next, and show the variables in scope.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can not edit or save your program while it is running or paused. Only a stopped
				program can be saved.
			</p>
			<h3>Micro world - Robot land</h3>
			<p>
				To the right of the code editor, you find the micro world for which we write the
				program. Currently, only one micro world is supported: robot land. The program you
				write is actually a program for the robot that lives in this micro world. The robot
				provides functions to our program that we can use to control the robot. The functions
				are listed and documented in the help panel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The toolbar at the top of the micro world lets you select a tool to modify the world.
				To use a tool, click it, then "draw" on the grid.
				<ul>
					<li>Robot: positions the robot on the grid. Clicking the robot itself will turn it.</li>
					<li>Floor: deletes any walls, numbers or letters.</li>
					<li>Wall: places walls.</li>
					<li>Number: places a number between 0-99 on the grid.</li>
					<li>Letter: places a letter on the grid.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				You can use these tools to setup the world for your robot to execute
				its program in. While your program runs, it may modify the world. However,
				once the program has stopped, the world gets reset to the state it was in
				before the program was run.
