			<h1>What is Paperbots?</h1>

			<p>
				Paperbots is an educational programming environment running in the browser. It
				was created to enable teaching or self-learning of computational thinking and programming.
			</p>

			<p>Paperbots consists of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <a href="https://github.com/badlogic/paperbots/tree/master/client/src/language">Wee programming language, compiler and virtual machine.</a></li>
				<li>The <a href="/">Paperbots website</a>, where users can
					<ul>
						<li>Create an account.</li>
						<li>Create programs for different micro worlds in a browser based IDE.</li>
						<li>Save programs to their account.</li>
						<li>Share programs with others.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The <a href="/learn.html">Paperbots course</a> guiding beginner's through learning computational thinking and programming.</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Why Paperbots?</h1>
			<p>
				The foremost goal of Paperbots is to make it easier to learn (and teach) computational
				thinking and programming.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many educational programming environments, like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>,
				commonly in use in computing education. Scratch is a great way to give kids up until the age of 12 a taste
				of computing. However, past that age, Scratch is viewed as being "for kids" and "not being the real deal".
				Young adults want something that is closer to the "real world". It is also not immediately clear
				how to go from Scratch to a "real" programming environment.
			<p>
				In that real world, "professional" programming languages, like Python or Lua, are touted as being great for
				beginners. While these languages are indeed great, their surrounding programming
				environments and ecosystems are very complex. It is non-trivial to get setup, and the development
				environments are overwhelming. It is also very hard to share programs you've created with
				these tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				With Paperbots, I'm trying to build a bridge between the world of Scratch and professional programming
				environments.
			</p>

			<h1>I know how to program, why should I care?</h1>
			<p>
				Because Paperbots is not only an educational tool, but also a recreational tool. If you are looking
				for a simple environment to quickly whip up and share ideas for small games or generative art,
				Paperbots might be for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a side-effect, your programs can serve as inspiration for beginners! And maybe yourself
				have kids or friends who'd like to get a glimpse into computational programming. Maybe Paperbots
				can be their pathway into that particular rabbit hole.
			</p>

			<h1>How to use this site</h1>
			<h2>Accounting</h2>
			<p>
				You may already have noticed the <code>Sign up</code> and <code>Log in</code> buttons in the top
				right corner.
			</p>
			<img src="/img/devs/login-signup.png">
			<p>
				You can create a new account with the former, or log in with the latter by providing
				your user name or email address.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you are logged in, your <code>user name</code> will appear in the top right corner. Click it to quickly
				access your most recent programs, view your profile, or log out.
			</p>
			<img src="/img/devs/user.png">
			<p>
				With an account, you can save and share your programs, and access them from multiple devices.
				That said, an account is not a requirement for creating programs on this site. They will however
				get lost forever as soon as you close the browser tab.
			</p>

			<h2>Creating and saving programs</h2>
			<img src="/img/devs/newsave.png">
			<p>
				The <code>New</code> button in the top left corner will open a blank program in the Paperbots IDE.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inside the IDE, you will get an additional button called <code>Save</code> that lets you save your
				program (provided you are logged in). The <code>Save</code> is also available when viewing other people's
				projects. Clicking it will save a copy of that program into your account.
			</p>
